-- name: ConsumeOAuthTransaction :one
-- Atomically claims a transaction: only a row that is unexpired and not yet
-- consumed (as of now, $2) is updated and returned. A handle that is
-- unknown, expired, or already consumed matches no row, so the caller sees
-- exactly one outcome (pgx.ErrNoRows) for all three cases -- see
-- internal/auth.ErrTransactionInvalid's doc comment for why that collapse
-- is deliberate. The provider-mismatch check (RFC 9700 mix-up defense)
-- happens in Go, after this still consumes the row: an attacker replaying
-- a valid handle against the wrong provider's callback burns the
-- transaction just like any other outcome, so it can never be retried
-- against the correct provider either.
